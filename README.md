How to Play
---------

This tic tac toe implementation is made with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The game is for a 3x3 grid, where 3 X's or 3 O's in a row, column, or diagonal, determines a winner.

You can click a box to start the game. Players take turn making their marks on the grid. Messages display the current player turn, if there's a winner, or if you need to choose a different box.

A 'Restart' button allows you to start a new game and continue playing.

Currently, the game is set up so that it's always X's turn first. Once you've had a winner, the winner will go first after you restart. If you wanted, you can randomize the turns during the setup.
